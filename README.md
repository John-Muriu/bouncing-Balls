# bouncing-Balls 
a simple js project for practicing  how to handle objects


With a mouse click on the canvas a new ball is created, aim with holding the mouse down and moving it (drag the mouse further from the start point for greater speed), shoot the new ball with releasing the mouse button. (also touch screens/devices are supported, the same rules are used for touch events)
